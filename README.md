# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

This Tic Tac Toe app was made using pure HTML, CSS and JS - no extra frameworks.

# Optimizations
The focus of the project was mainly to play around with some DOM manipulation and general user interactivity, while gathering info from players and handling any bugs that come up. If I spent more time on the project, I would add much more to its UI to make it more exciting, as right now it has no design.

# Lessons Learned:
Given that it had been a while since I had used Javascript, I learned a lot about quickly picking things back up and effeciently searching for the answers I needed. After spending so much time with Ruby, I had initially forgotten some things with JS. But with just an hour or 2 refresher, I was right back up to speed and feeling comfortable with it. The big lesson here is that of course, you can't remember every single thing about every language. Its important to know the fundamentals, and with that, you'll have the ability to pick anything back up quickly.
